Released 1.1 beta. [See the changelog here.](https://github.com/stefansundin/altdrag/releases) Please help me test this beta real quick, I am going to release the final 1.1 version this weekend.

**Due to changes in the installer, I recommend everyone to uninstall and install from scratch!**

Due to lack of time, I have honestly only tested this version in Windows 10. Please let me know if it breaks Windows XP or Windows 7.

There are still some bugs in Windows 10, but I haven't found any major issues.

I am being forced to release a new version before Google Code shuts down, otherwise I will be unable to notify everyone that there is a new version available. Maybe this is a good thing, otherwise the next version might have taken a very long time. I recently made an effort to move all of the documentation here, let me know if anything is missing.

Lastly, I want to thank everyone who have donated. All support is greatly appreciated!
