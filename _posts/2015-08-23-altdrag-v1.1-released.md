Released 1.1. [See the changelog here.](https://github.com/stefansundin/altdrag/releases)

There are a few fixes in this new version, but I am mostly being forced to release it because Google Code is shutting down, and this is my last chance to notify the users of v1.0 that there is a new version.

**The installer has changed to install into your user's directory by default. I therefore recommend that you uninstall any previous version and then install from scratch!**

I have plans to make the AltDrag source code simpler (by removing features), please see [this issue](https://github.com/stefansundin/altdrag/issues/39) if you have any opinions.

Lastly, I want to thank everyone who have donated. All support is greatly appreciated!
